The pure untyped language behind [Formality](https://github.com/moonad/formality).

[Specification.](spec.md)

## Usage

Right now, this repository includes a small, dependency-free JS implementation, including parser, interpreter and optimal (NASIC) reducer. Using it from the terminal is simple:

```
npm i -g elementary-affine-calculus
eac term_name # in a directory with .eac files
```

You can also import it and use as a library.
